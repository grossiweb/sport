  - Consistent sizing across components

### 5. Logo Directory Structure
```
public/
├── nfl/
│   ├── nfl-61.png
│   ├── nfl-62.png
│   └── ... (more NFL logos)
└── cfb/
    └── (CFB logos to be added with same naming convention)
```

## File Changes

### New Files
- `components/ui/TeamLogo.tsx` - Team logo component with fallbacks
- `components/matchups/ModernMatchupCard.tsx` - New matchup card design
- `components/matchups/ModernMatchupDetail.tsx` - New detail page component

### Modified Files
- `app/sport/[sport]/matchups/page.tsx` - Updated to use ModernMatchupCard
- `app/sport/[sport]/matchups/[gameId]/page.tsx` - Updated to use ModernMatchupDetail

## Features

### Team Logo Display
- Automatic logo loading based on sport and team ID
- Graceful fallback to team initials when logos are unavailable
- Support for team primary colors in fallback displays
- Multiple size options for different use cases

### Modern Design Elements
- Card-based layouts with subtle shadows
- Gradient backgrounds for special sections
- Hover animations and transitions
- Color-coded status indicators
- Professional spacing and typography

### Real Stats Integration
- No fake stats - all data comes from existing endpoints
- Real betting data display
- Actual team records and conference information
- Live game status indicators

## Usage

### Team Logos
The system automatically attempts to load logos from:
- NFL: `/nfl/nfl-{teamId}.png`
- CFB: `/cfb/cfb-{teamId}.png`

If a logo is not found, it displays a fallback with team initials.

### Responsive Design
All components are fully responsive and work on:
- Desktop (lg and xl breakpoints)
- Tablet (md breakpoint)
- Mobile (sm and base breakpoints)

## Next Steps

1. **Upload CFB Logos**: Add CFB team logos to `/public/cfb/` using the same naming convention
2. **Team Colors**: Consider adding team primary/secondary colors to the database for better fallback styling
3. **Additional Stats**: Enhance the stats sections with more detailed team analytics
4. **Performance**: Optimize logo loading with Next.js Image component features

## Technical Notes

- All components use TypeScript for type safety
- No linter errors or TypeScript errors
- Uses existing API endpoints for data
- Maintains existing caching and optimization strategies
- Compatible with existing dark/light mode theming
